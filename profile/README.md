# Hubble <code style="color : red">(Currently In Beta)</code>

**Hubble** is a web-based social platform that combines text posts with quick and live messaging, user profiles, and games new and loved.

Lightweight, fast, and just a single bookmarklet â€” no downloads, no setup, just instant access to a new kind of gaming and social experience unblockable by Dyknow and iBoss (your screen is still visible on Dyknow and the install site can still be blocked so set it up quick!).
