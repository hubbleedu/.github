# 🌌 Hubble

**Hubble** is a web-based social platform that combines text posts with quick and live messaging, user profiles, and games new and loved.

Lightweight, fast, and just a single bookmarklet — no downloads, no setup, just instant access to a new kind of social experience unblockable by Dyknow and iBoss (your screen is still visible on Dyknow and the install site can still be blocked so set it up quick!).
